	       	<p>Whenever I look at cats or any other animal for that matter, I always wonder what they are thinking. It’s been proven that cats and other animals sense emotions. For that reason, if cats could talk, they’d probably say some of the following things. </p>

	       	<p>Cats are loners. They’re solitary creatures. That is a popular belief of many of people. Who can blame us though? Cats aren’t like dogs, running around excitedly when people come over, wanting to play with people and animals alike whenever they can. Cats are generally more reserved to say the least. However, that doesn’t mean they’re antisocial.</p>
